# Co-Create with AI
Welcome to Co-Create with AI, a hands-on workshop of generative AI models at Women in Data Science Oslo!

![45bz8t48-400](https://github.com/mbertani/genai-workshop/assets/21079942/4d92f44d-b706-40a0-8165-6f1f4acc641e)


## Plan of the day
9:30 - 10:20: 30m opening talk + 20m tips sharing

10:20 - 10:30 10m break and people choose tracks

10:30 - 12:00: 1.5 hours hands-on time in small groups

12:00 - 12:30: share out

The goal today is to create a picture book on a topic of your choice. During the hands-on time, you will work in small groups that are formed by people who choose similar topics. You can choose to colaborate to create one book as a group or share the best tips with your group mates and create your own version of book.

In addition to the share out session at the end, if you have some good results, please share any time by uploading a screenshot to the folder here <add a folder>.

## Tracks

We have prepared different tracks based on your previous experience with generative AI models like GPT and Stable Diffusion. Please follow the instructions below and get prepared before we meet on 27th :)

### Track 1: New beginners
If you have only heard about tools like chatGPT and Midjourney but have never tried them out, we recommend to register an account at the following services before you come to the workshop:

ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/

BingChat: https://www.bing.com/

DALL-E: https://openai.com/dall-e-2

Stability.ai: https://stability.ai/

Other image generative services: https://ideogram.ai/, https://www.mage.space/

Note we don't include Midjourney here, because it only offers paid service. However, it is one of the services offer the best results.

### Track 2: Intermediate
You have tried a couple of prompts and wonder how to get better results. You want to try some prompt engineering and fine tuning.

Try out some applications here: https://huggingface.co/

You can find more fine-tuned image generation models at https://civitai.com/, but please be aware there are lots of NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) content there. 

Using fine tuned models is often a paid feature. You can use the notebook here to host your own services.

### Track 3: Advanced
You are ready to fine tune with your own data! It is hard to avoid some codes at this level, but we try to keep it to the minimum.

For fine tuning large langauge models, you can try this notebook here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PEQyJO1-f6j0S_XJ8DV50NkpzasXkrzd?usp=sharing.

For fine tuning image models, you can follow the instructions here: https://civitai.com/models/22530/guide-make-your-own-loras-easy-and-free.

Note that due to the limited time, you probably won't have enough time to train your new model and use it for creation today.

### Track 4: Researcher
If you have hands-on experience fine-tuning (or even training!) a GPT or Stable Diffusion model, this workshop will be more of a seminar experience for you. Please bring your fine-tuned models and share your experience.  

Due to the time limitation (and advantages of the new generation of models), we don't expect you to write much code

## Share your results

We want you to share your results with you, and we have prepared a Miro board for this. You can access the board at:
